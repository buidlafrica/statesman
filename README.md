### Problem ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
Political Manifestos are mostly untrue, most politicians provide the mass 
with fake background information about themselves and document Manifestos 
that they are not willing to fulfill 

### Proposed Solution
- A platform that allows the general public source information about a 
statesman in their locality, 
- Check and validate their bio information
- Check and validate projects for those in office who claim these has 
been completed
- Verify and track the promises of these political manifestos
